## Roadmap

Here is a list of features I plan to implement:

- [x] Diagnostics functions (errors, warnings, information and debug levels) that log on stderr
- [x] Conditionnaly display log levels based on an environment variable
- [x] Optional script name display
- [ ] Optional script line display
- [ ] Simple log functions that output on stdout
- [x] Style sheets with customizable formatting and colors
- [ ] Execute function that can log the output of a command (behavior to be defined)
